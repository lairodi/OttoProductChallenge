# OttoProductChallenge
This project explores various classification methods and tries to find the best model for classifying a group of products. The dataset used is from the Otto
Group Product Classification Challenge on Kaggle. Some of the models that will be explored are decision trees, neural network, gradient boosting model. All
these models will then be bench marked against an ElasticNet classifier (Zou and Hastie, 2005). The best model will be selected by cross validation and comparing the prediction accuracy of the models. The ultimate goal is to get a better understanding of the various models in order and apply to a work (real
world) scenario (classifying customer preferences for window coverings).
